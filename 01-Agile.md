# 01 - Agile

## What is Agile?

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that focuses on delivering value to customers through early and continuous delivery of working software. It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and responding to change.

The Agile Manifesto, written in 2001 by a group of software developers, outlines the values and principles of Agile. The four values of Agile are:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP), provide frameworks for implementing Agile principles in software development projects. Scrum is one of the most popular Agile methodologies, and it emphasizes teamwork, communication, and frequent feedback.
