# 08-Story Points

Story Points are a way of estimating the effort required to complete a User Story. The Fibonacci sequence is commonly used to assign Story Points to User Stories. The sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc. Here's a breakdown of the Story Points commonly used in Scrum, along with examples:

1. 0: This is used for User Stories that require no effort to complete, such as fixing a typo or updating documentation.
2. 1: This is used for User Stories that are very simple and can be completed quickly, such as adding a button or changing a color.
3. 2: This is used for User Stories that are slightly more complex, but still relatively simple, such as adding a new field to a form or creating a basic report.
4. 3: This is used for User Stories that are moderately complex and require more effort to complete, such as integrating with an external system or implementing a new workflow.
5. 5: This is used for User Stories that are complex and require significant effort to complete, such as building a new feature from scratch or completely redesigning a page.
6. 8: This is used for User Stories that are very complex and require a lot of effort to complete, such as implementing a new payment gateway or completely overhauling the architecture of an application.
7. 13: This is used for User Stories that are extremely complex and require a significant amount of effort to complete, such as building a new integration with a complex API or completely rewriting a large portion of the codebase.
8. 21: This is used for User Stories that are even more complex and require a massive amount of effort to complete, such as building a new product from scratch or overhauling the entire application architecture.
9. 40: This is used for User Stories that are extremely large and complex, and may require multiple sprints or teams to complete.
10. 100: This is used for User Stories that are so large and complex that they cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy.

## Story Points are ranges

Story Points are not meant to be an exact measurement of time or effort. Instead, they represent a range of effort required to complete a User Story relative to other User Stories.

For example, a 5-point User Story might be considered to be roughly equivalent in effort to completing two 2-point User Stories and a 1-point User Story. It's important to note that this is just an estimation, and the actual effort required to complete a User Story may vary based on a number of factors, such as technical complexity, dependencies on other User Stories, and the specific skills and experience of the development team.

Because of this range-based approach, it's common for teams to use a range of Story Points when estimating User Stories. For example, a 5-point User Story might actually be estimated as a range of 3-8 points, to account for the fact that there is some uncertainty around the actual effort required to complete the story. This range-based approach helps teams to more accurately estimate the relative effort required to complete different User Stories, while still allowing for some flexibility in the actual amount of effort required to complete each story.

## Story Points are not true estimates

It's important to note that the specific numbers used for Story Points may vary between teams, and that Story Points are not meant to be a precise measurement of time or effort. Rather, they are a way to estimate the relative effort required to complete different User Stories. By using Story Points, the development team can more effectively plan their sprints and ensure that they are taking on an appropriate amount of work.

## Velocity

Velocity is a metric used in Agile development to measure the amount of work a team can complete in a given time period. It is calculated by adding up the story points for all the completed user stories in a sprint or iteration.

The idea behind velocity is that by tracking how many story points the team completes in each sprint, you can establish a baseline for the team's productivity. This can then be used to forecast how much work the team can complete in future sprints and to estimate how long it will take to complete a project.

Velocity is typically measured in story points per sprint or iteration. For example, if a team completes 20 story points in a two-week sprint, their velocity would be 10 story points per week.

It's important to note that velocity is not a measure of how many hours the team works or how many tasks they complete. Rather, it is a measure of the amount of value the team is delivering in terms of completed user stories.

Velocity can be used in conjunction with other metrics such as burn-up charts and burn-down charts to track progress and forecast completion time. By tracking velocity over time, the team can identify trends and adjust their estimates and plans accordingly.
