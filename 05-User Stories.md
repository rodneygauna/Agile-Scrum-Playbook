# 05-User Stories

A User Story is a way of describing a feature or requirement in Scrum. It is a brief, high-level description of a feature that outlines what the user needs and why they need it. Here's a detailed explanation of what a User Story is, what should be included in a User Story, and how the team participates to build that User Story:

## What is a User Story?

A User Story is a way of describing a feature or requirement from the perspective of the end user. It is typically written in a simple, easy-to-understand format that focuses on what the user needs and why they need it. A User Story is not a detailed technical specification; rather, it is a high-level description of a feature that provides a clear understanding of what the user wants to achieve.

### What should be included in a User Story?

A User Story should include several key components:

1. Title: A brief, descriptive title that summarizes the User Story.
2. Description: A brief, high-level description of the feature, written from the perspective of the end user.
3. Acceptance criteria: A list of specific criteria that must be met for the User Story to be considered complete.
4. Priority: A ranking of the importance of the User Story, typically assigned by the Product Owner.
5. Estimate: An estimate of the effort required to complete the User Story, typically assigned by the development team.
6. Dependencies: Any dependencies that the User Story has on other work or teams.

### How does the team participate to build a User Story?

The process of building a User Story typically involves the Product Owner, the development team, and potentially other stakeholders such as designers or user researchers. Here are the steps typically involved in building a User Story:

- Identify the User Story: The Product Owner is responsible for identifying the User Story, based on input from stakeholders such as users, customers, or the development team.
- Define the User Story: The Product Owner works with the development team to define the User Story, including the title, description, acceptance criteria, priority, estimate, and any dependencies.
- Refine the User Story: The development team may ask clarifying questions or suggest changes to the User Story to ensure that it is clear and feasible.
- Estimate the User Story: The development team estimates the effort required to complete the User Story, based on their understanding of the requirements and any technical constraints.
- Prioritize the User Story: The Product Owner prioritizes the User Story based on its business value and the needs of the end users.
- Accept the User Story: The Product Owner reviews the User Story and accepts it if it meets the acceptance criteria and aligns with the overall goals of the project.

By following these steps, the development team can ensure that they have a clear understanding of the User Story and that it is feasible and aligned with the goals of the project. This can help to reduce rework and ensure that the team is delivering value to the end users.
