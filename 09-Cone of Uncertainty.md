# 09-Cone of Uncertainty

The "Cone of Uncertainty" is a concept used in Agile development to forecast the completion time of a feature or project. The idea behind the Cone of Uncertainty is that early on in a project, there is a lot of uncertainty in terms of how long it will take to complete a feature or project. As time goes on and more information is gathered, the level of uncertainty decreases, and a more accurate forecast can be made.

To use the Cone of Uncertainty to forecast the completion time of a feature, you need to start by establishing a baseline estimate. This estimate should be based on the team's initial understanding of the feature and the available information at the time. The baseline estimate should be treated as an estimate with a high level of uncertainty.

As the team progresses through the development process, the level of uncertainty will decrease, and the estimate will become more accurate. At each stage of the development process, the team should revisit the estimate and adjust it based on new information.

The Cone of Uncertainty is a visual representation of the range of possible completion times for a feature or project. The cone starts wide at the beginning of the project when the level of uncertainty is highest. As the team progresses through the development process and more information becomes available, the cone narrows, indicating a smaller range of possible completion times.

It's important to note that the Cone of Uncertainty is not a guarantee of completion time. Rather, it is a tool to help the team and stakeholders understand the level of uncertainty and to manage expectations. As the team gains more information, they can use the Cone of Uncertainty to forecast the completion time more accurately.

In addition to the Cone of Uncertainty, Agile development also uses metrics such as velocity, burn-up charts, and burn-down charts to measure progress and forecast completion time. These metrics are based on the team's actual performance and can be used to adjust the estimate as the team progresses through the development process.
