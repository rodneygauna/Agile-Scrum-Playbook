# 07-Definition of Done

The "Definition of Done" is a key concept in Scrum that outlines the criteria that must be met before a User Story can be considered complete. The specific rules that the development team must meet before a User Story can be marked as "Done" can vary depending on the project and team, but here are some general guidelines:

1. Functionality: The User Story must meet all of the functional requirements outlined in the acceptance criteria.
2. Design: The User Story must meet all of the design requirements and be consistent with the overall design of the product.
3. Code: The User Story must be implemented with high-quality, maintainable code that adheres to the coding standards of the team.
4. Testing: The User Story must be thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the acceptance criteria and functions as expected. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and any other relevant testing.
5. Documentation: The User Story must be fully documented, including any necessary user documentation or technical documentation.
6. Performance: The User Story must meet any performance requirements outlined in the acceptance criteria, such as response times or scalability.
7. Security: The User Story must meet any security requirements outlined in the acceptance criteria, such as data encryption or authentication.
8. Review: The User Story must be reviewed and approved by the Product Owner to ensure that it meets the acceptance criteria and aligns with the overall goals of the project.

By adhering to these rules and ensuring that each User Story meets the "Definition of Done," the development team can ensure that they are delivering high-quality, fully functional features that meet the needs of the end users and align with the overall goals of the project.
