# 10-The Business & Agile

by moving to Agile and Scrum, the company should expect an iterative approach, customer feedback, collaboration, continuous improvement, transparency, and flexibility. However, the company should not expect fixed scope and deadlines, predictable delivery, use of Scrum for evaluating development performance, or absence of documentation. It's important for the company to have a clear understanding of what to expect and what not to expect when adopting Agile and Scrum to ensure a successful implementation.

## Expectations

**Iterative approach:** Agile is an iterative approach, which means that the development process is broken down into smaller, manageable chunks of work. This allows the team to focus on delivering working software in short iterations or sprints. The company should expect that the development team will be delivering small, but valuable increments of the product in each sprint.

**Customer feedback is vital:** Customer feedback is an integral part of Agile. The company should expect that the development team will be continuously seeking feedback from the customer to ensure that they are building the right product. The company should also expect that the customer feedback will be used to improve the product backlog, prioritize User Stories, and make necessary changes to the product.

**Collaboration:** Agile promotes collaboration between the development team, stakeholders, and the customer. The company should expect that the development team will be working closely with stakeholders and the customer to understand their requirements and to ensure that they are delivering what is expected.

**Continuous improvement:** Agile is about continuous improvement. The company should expect that the development team will be continuously looking for ways to improve their process, the quality of the product, and the customer experience.

**Transparency:** Agile promotes transparency, which means that the company should expect that the development team will be transparent about their progress, any issues they are facing, and the status of the product backlog.

**Flexibility:** Agile promotes flexibility, which means that the company should expect that the development team will be able to adapt to changing requirements, priorities, and customer needs.

## What Not to Expect

**Fixed scope and deadlines:** Agile is an iterative approach, which means that the scope and deadlines may change based on feedback and priorities. The company should not expect that the scope and deadlines will be fixed.

**Predictable delivery:** While Agile promotes delivering working software in short iterations or sprints, it does not guarantee predictable delivery. The company should not expect that the development team will deliver every User Story within the estimated time frame or that the team will always deliver the same amount of work in each sprint.

**Use of Scrum for evaluating development performance:** Scrum and Story Points are not meant to evaluate individual performance. The company should not expect that the development team will be evaluated based on their Story Point estimates or the number of User Stories they complete in a sprint. Instead, the focus should be on delivering value to the customer.

**Absence of documentation:** While Agile promotes working software over comprehensive documentation, it does not mean that documentation is not required. The company should not expect that the development team will not produce any documentation.
