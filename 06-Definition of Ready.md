# 06-Definition of Ready

The "Definition of Ready" is a concept in Scrum that outlines the criteria that must be met before the development team is ready to begin working on a new User Story or feature. The Product Manager and/or Product Owner are responsible for defining the "Definition of Ready" and ensuring that it is met before the development team begins working on the User Story. Here are some common criteria that may be included in a "Definition of Ready":

1. Clear business value: The User Story must have a clear business value and align with the overall goals of the project.
2. Clear acceptance criteria: The User Story must have clear acceptance criteria that define what the feature should do and how it will be tested.
3. Sufficient detail: The User Story must be detailed enough for the development team to understand the requirements and estimate the effort required to complete the work.
4. Dependencies identified: Any dependencies that the User Story has on other work or teams must be identified and addressed before the development team can begin work.
5. User research: The User Story should be informed by user research or feedback to ensure that it meets the needs of the end users.
6. Design completed: The User Story should have a design or wireframe completed to ensure that the development team understands the intended user experience.
7. Resources available: The Product Manager and/or Product Owner should ensure that the necessary resources, such as data or APIs, are available to complete the User Story.

By ensuring that the "Definition of Ready" is met before the development team begins working on a User Story, the Product Manager and/or Product Owner can help to ensure that the team has a clear understanding of the requirements and that the work is aligned with the overall goals of the project. This can help to reduce rework and ensure that the team is delivering value to the end users.
