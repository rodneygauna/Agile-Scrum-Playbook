# 02 Scrum

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is an Agile framework for software development that focuses on delivering high-quality software in short iterations, typically 2-4 weeks long. It is based on the principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

In Scrum, a cross-functional team works together to deliver a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each iteration. The team self-organizes and is responsible for planning, executing, and delivering the work.

The Scrum framework includes several roles, including:

1. Product Owner: responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog, which is a list of all the features and requirements for the product.
2. Scrum Master: responsible for facilitating the Scrum process and ensuring the team is following the Scrum framework.
3. Development Team: responsible for delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint.

The Scrum framework also includes several ceremonies, such as:

- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

These Scrum ceremonies help the team to plan, monitor progress, and continually improve their work.

By using Scrum, teams can deliver high-quality software in a predictable and iterative manner, while also enabling flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements and market conditions.
